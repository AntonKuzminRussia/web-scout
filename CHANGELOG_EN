0.3 (dev)
Modules HostsBrute* added
In DNS brute modules added param --ignore-ip (see docs)
Combine modules added for Dafs and DnsBrute
DNS brute modules output now contains full list (host+ip+dns) and separate lists (hosts only and ips only)
DNS brute modules check msymbol in host template
All Selenium threads write requests content in log in binary mode (off random unicode troubles)
Proxies checks by target host, not by google more
